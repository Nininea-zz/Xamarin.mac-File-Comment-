# Xamarin.mac-File-Comment-


This application demostrates how to use  finder comments in xamarin.mac application. 

But here is a bug, sometimes application is not able to get up to date comment. 


you shoudk upload two photos , then click 'info' button , set some comment and click 'save'. all of two photos should 
add new commen. (if you will check in findr, comments are really changed). Then view comment of each photos, first one will be 
up to date and the second one will be old.
